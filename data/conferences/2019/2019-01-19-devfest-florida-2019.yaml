      Struggling to get your website to load in less than 5 seconds on a mobile phone? Switching pages are a little sluggish? You’re not alone! Most web developers can build a responsive site, but fail to meet performance requirements for mobile. Using the latest PRPL pattern and Progressive Web API’s, you can provide a compelling alternative to native apps, as long as performance remains your top feature.This talk will cover the architecture for Xfinity xFi, an enterprise PWA for Comcast, built with Google Polymer. We’ll then dive into the Chrome performance tools to optimize xFi loading time down by more than half. You’ll walk away knowing what it takes to create a successful PWA and how to find slow downs in your app startup.

      Since launch, almost all iOS apps were designed for a single screen, but with Marzipan on macOS and USB-C monitors on iPad that's finally about to change. In this talk you'll learn how to build apps that work great across multiple windows, first with a walkthrough of all the theory then a live coding demonstration so you can see exactly what the steps are.

      Are you still console-logging all of your Node.js code? Would you like to learn to debug with zero configuration? How about debugging docker? Or logging messages without changing your code with console.log? Would you like an easier way to pair when you just need a second set of eyes to debug your app? Join me and learn how easy it can be to find and squash those bugs in your code! Find the latest information about speakers, agenda, and other exciting news at devfestflorida.org

      Angular Material provides core components and a Component Dev Kit. However, it's up to developers to integrate the various core components when creating an application. The docs are focused on individual components (behaviors, APIs, etc). In this talk, we'll dig deep into the code with concrete, real-world examples of how to compose a quality, accessible user experience with Angular Material.

      In this talk we'll learn how to use all the power of Google stack technologies (Angular, Material, Firebase and Google Cloud) to develop a full stack application. We'll learn how we can empower a serverless Angular + Material application with Firebase and reactive programming by using realtime database, Firestore, authentication (with different providers) and Firebase hosting. And we if need any other functionality, we can use Cloud Functions or a NodeJS app. This talk will demonstrate the overview of a real world application (40k users), along with CI configuration and some details of the code (the good parts!).

      In the world of software engineering, there are those of us who work daily on iterating-over, and improving, a single legacy application.You might be interested in moving your UI toward a modern reactive framework; but how do you leverage this on an older system without dumping your original product entirely and starting over from scratch?I've recently done this very thing - adding a VueJS front-end as the new face of an old Rails App, shifting the UI in piecemeal while supporting both old and new architecture with VueJS components.

      As developers, we want to create apps that engage users across multiple devices. But building native apps is costly and cumbersome. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of mobile apps using new web standards, including service workers, push notifications, and homescreen access. In this session, you’ll learn the the fundamentals needed for building Progressive Web Apps, including the app shell model, how to use service workers to cache the App Shell and your key application data and more!

      React Native is advertised as a framework for developing native apps with javascript. Roughly 90% of the time, my team is able to work strictly in javascript, with only occassional trips into native code. In particular, my team has found our Android build to require more care than its iOS counterpart. This talk will look at the ways in which we have learned, sometimes the hard way, how to develop a react native app for Android, as well as my experience as a javascript developer being thrust into the native world. In particular, I will discuss our use of the react native device detection package to work through our Android style audits and ways we have worked around react native's shortcomings.
