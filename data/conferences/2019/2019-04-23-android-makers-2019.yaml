      Our responsibility as developers is to ship high quality features in a timely manner. But there are many factors which can hinder development: from tightly coupled, untested codebases, to differences between team members in architecture visions and API knowledge, to time pressure. We tend to look at app development from one point of view: the code. But the team that writes that code is as important as the code, so we need to work on architecting a good, solid team as well, making sure that we create a common language in the team, a shared vision and an environment where team members learn and communicate freely.In this talk, I’m going to cover some of the lessons I learned along the way and show how we, a team of four, applied them in rewriting Plaid - an open source app, initially created to showcase Material Design. We’ll see how intertwined the code and the team were for the project.

      Many teams are designed so that engineers can take an abstract view of the customer and focus on implementation. But when the customers are other engineers, that entire dynamic is thrown on its head.In this talk, Ty will walk you through the best practices of building great products for developers, from team processes to the technical delivery.Topics covered will include: Building customer personas and product strategies, Developer Experience research and analytics, customer empathy and support structures, API Design and usability, testing, code distribution, and creating great documentation.

      At Badoo, we have a long history when it comes to Android development. Since the beginning, the product has experienced huge growth, and our codebase and our team have grown with it. We now have over 400 million registrations, as well as several new apps to support. Over the years we’ve tried MVP, Clean architecture, MVI, and many more approaches, some of them brewed in-house. In this talk we’ll go on an architectural journey and discuss some of the major problems we needed to find solutions for in the last few years, before ending on what is ahead of us.

      Let’s face it, we waste a lot of time on things that don't add any value. Maybe you use the same pattern in different places and copy&paste the same files over and over. Probably the same happens whenever you create a new app or module. What about all the time that you spend in Jira or other tools on tasks like moving tickets or logging time?. What if you could automate all that? Well, you can, and I’m going to show you how by writing your own Android Studio Plugin.In this talk you will learn how to create a new Android Studio Plugin using Kotlin, create templates to generate code automatically, write live templates to insert frequently-used constructors in your code, easily integrate Android Studio with Jira or other tools, create a brand new full App in minutes using feature modules and much more.

      What if you could answer all these questions with the help of a low cost device farm that fits into a pocket? A pocket full of clouds…Poddingue, our proposal, aims to tackle this problem thanks to Docker, HypriotOS, Armbian, Gitlab CI and OpenSTF. It’s an internal solution made of OSS readily available, but it has not yet been publicly announced as a whole.At the end of the talk, you should know how to build your own cloudy pocket farm of Android devices and how to use it to test your applications within your ci pipeline.

      Kotlin offers many powerful language features that make it a welcome addition to the Android developer's toolkit. But some of these features may do significant work behind the scenes, including allocating object and reflection. This dynamic is not obvious from the Kotlin code, so how do we know when this is happening? This talk will go over some of these areas that you should be aware of, as well as the tools that help us discover this kind of information about our code.

      There's been attempts to circumvent these issues with AsyncTask (no comment), Futures (from JDK, Guava, and more), Tasks API (from Google Play Services), reactive programming (e.g. RxJava used for threading and callbacks), and none solves all the issues mentioned above.Kotlin coroutines are changing the game with an implementation of the nearly 60 years old concept that brings back the simplicity of blocking code, without the blocking issue.In this talk, you'll see how any waiting or blocking code can be made easier to write and read.You'll learn how to use kotlinx.coroutines correctly in Android, and peek at how it all works.

      So instead of explaining why an architecture is better than another, let's discuss some issues we face in our daily Android development job and how we can solve those through 3 examples:1. I have crashes I can't reproduce.2. Integration tests are great and necessary to ensure a complete flow is working as expected, but they are complex to set up, and it takes time to run the whole test suite when using an instrumentation tool such as Espresso 3. My legacy app has some "startActivity" calls in activites, fragments, custom views, and even in RecyclerView adapters (who did that !?!). I have no visibility regarding the overall navigation of and the code is sometimes hard to follow.We will see today the concepts underneath and how such an architecture can be implemented using functional programming patterns through writing a Kotlin DSL.

      ConstraintLayout is a popular library for UI development on Android. It is deeply integrated with the Android Studio design tools, allowing developers to quickly create complex and reactive UIs. We recently released ConstraintLayout 2.0, which brings even more layout capabilities, virtual viewgroups, performance improvements and flexible ways to organize your UI. More uniquely, the library also provides powerful animation and motion handling capabilities via MotionLayout, a subclass of ConstraintLayout. All together, this new declarative approach makes it very easy to create modern, motion-enabled UIs for your application.This talk will cover the new capabilities of the library, common pitfalls and solutions to UI patterns, performance aspects, integrating motion, and how to best take advantage of the library in your own application via a series of use cases and examples.

      You want to style the title of dialogs throughout your app and you think it should be simple enough. However, once you dive into it, you might start asking questions - should I use alertDialogTheme or alertDialogStyle? Should I use windowTitle or dialogTitle? It is no secret that the styling and theming system in Android is complex, but I promise there is some method to the madness! We can avoid writing custom components just to achieve pixel perfection if we know how tame to the beast.In this talk, we will learn about the difference between themes and styles, the hierarchy of different styling techniques and how to use them effectively. We will also learn how they work internally, and the best practices of how to apply them. We will wrap up by discussing the newest app theme in town - the Material Components Theme and the attributes that come with it, like “colorOnSurface”. At the end of this talk, you will know how to style your app like a pro with the correct use of Styles, Themes, TextAppearance and sensible defaults while specifying colour, shape and typography through Material Theming.

      If you’ve used Firebase Performance Monitoring, you know that it automatically discovers and reports performance metrics for all the HTTP transactions in your app.  But have you ever wondered how it does that?  Android doesn’t provide any APIs to listen in on an arbitrary connection (that would be a security problem!), and Firebase supports URLConnection, Apache, and OKHTTP APIs.  The secret here is bytecode manipulation at build time using the Transform API provided by the Android build tools.  Join this session to find out how the Firebase Performance Monitoring Gradle plugin intercepts and measures HTTP transactions at runtime with some assistance from bytecode manipulation at build time.

Qu'est-il possible de faire aujourd'hui, quels sont les risques pour l'utilisateur, le développeur, l'entreprise ? Quels sont les outils et bonnes pratiques pour empêcher ou au moins ralentir et complexifier nos analyses réseau par des personnes malicieuses ?

      Animations bring your app to life but often we write them as pre-canned sequences that once started can’t be interrupted or redirected. Modern Android apps are reactive to state changes… your animations should be as well. This talk looks at techniques for writing animations that work like state machines, that can be interrupted or retargeted while running. We’ll look at ways to architect your animations to achieve this, and libraries and classes that we can utilize.

      Dagger is a complex tool, we can all agree on that. It's also the most performant and scalable dependency injector we have available -- no wonder it's the official recommendation from Google when it comes to dependency injection for Android apps. And yet, we keep looking for simpler alternatives (usually service locators) just so we don't have to deal with it.Even thought Dagger is complex, it doesn't have to be complicated. It's possible to keep things simple and still take advantage of what it offers at its core. There are many ways to setup Dagger, and believe it or not, some of them are quite simple. The goal of this talk is to present a simplistic approach to Dagger, where we can take advantage of dependency injection with minimal boilerplate and optimum performance. On top of that, we'll be looking in details on best practices and how to ensure you're taking the most out of Dagger.Join me if you've had unpleasant experiences with Dagger -- or even if you're happy with your current setup -- so we can take a fresh look on how we can work with it. And if you haven't worked with Dagger before, this is the perfect opportunity to get off on the right foot!

      Que l’on développe une application pour smartphones ou pour un IoT, la connectivité est un élément clé. Idéalement, on voudrait à la fois minimiser la latence et la consommation d’énergie. Concrètement, c’est difficilement faisable. En balayant tout un tas de technos, du WiFi à LTE-M, en passant par la 2,3,4,5G, nous verrons les mécanismes qui sont mis en place pour préserver l’autonomie d’un appareil et qui inévitablement induisent de la latence.

      Until now, in order to perform background work in Android, developers had to choose between multiple execution options. At Google I/O 2018, the Android team launched WorkManager as part of the Android Jetpack. This library provides a simple and clean interface to specify deferrable, asynchronous tasks and when they should run.The presentation will include an overview about the existing background solutions, what’s happening behind the scenes and why and when we should use WorkManager. Also, we will discover details about the architecture of the WorkManager library and about the main components(Worker, WorkRequest, WorkManager, WorkInfo) of it. Finally, we will highlight how to use WorkManager for scenarios like chained sequences of tasks that run in a specified order, unique named sequences, tasks that pass and return values and how to apply constraints in order to decide when to run the task.

      Une fois rentré dans l’industrie du développement, les challenges de code restent souvent un lointain souvenir des études, ou dans le meilleur des cas des exercices d’entretien que l’on connait par coeur. Ces défis ont pourtant participé à forger notre passion pour l’informatique, ainsi qu’à nous initier à des concepts d’algorithmie et de structure de données, et parfois même à nous offrir nos premiers pas dans un langage. Des connaissances qui contribuent aujourd’hui à la qualité de notre travail. Curieux de voir ce que ces défis peuvent encore apporter à nos équipes de développeurs, nous nous sommes organisés pour participer collectivement au challenge adventofcode.com.Advent of Code est-il un bon moyen pour s'initier à un nouveau langage comme Kotlin ? Cet exercice personnel peut-il s’inscrire dans une dynamique d’équipe ? Ces challenges ont-ils encore des choses à nous apprendre ?Je vous propose de partager tous les enseignements accumulés durant ce mois un peu fou, et qui sait, peut-être cela vous incitera-t-il à tenter l’aventure dans votre entreprise ?

      In this talk, we’ll examine the details behind video playback on Android. We’ll look at the actors that play a role in delivering decoded video pixels to the screen. We’ll go beyond the high-level MediaPlayer / ExoPlayer components and examine what's happening in the system. Understanding how video playback works under the hood can help you figure out how to get the best performance for your applications.We’ll cover the details behind fundamental graphics components used by video rendering: e.g. SurfaceView, TextureView, SurfaceTexture, etc. These components also enable more complex media rendering such as 360 videos, 3D scenes, and AR experiences.We hope to leave you empowered to look deeper into the Android system beyond the high-level Android framework components and expand your knowledge and expertise.

      Sharing code between platforms is a powerful technique, but it may be hard to accomplish without rich APIs that we have in Android, JVM, or iOS platforms. Kotlin Multiplatform libraries can be used to fix that, bringing rich APIs directly in the common Kotlin code. In this talk we'll go over the creation of a Kotlin Multiplatform library. You'll learn how modules for each platform work, decide what parts of the code makes sense to share and what doesn't. All based in the experiences gathered after creating a library at Mixtiles used to fetch images from different cloud providers.

The possibility to integrate a model directly on Firebase is crazy, but the second part (often put aside) deserves attention.Based in majority on deprecated Mobile Vision, the few models offered by Google already give us something to enjoy. Most of them is available offline: so we can imagine the extent of the possibilities!

      Working with a design system can be hugely rewarding: layouts can be created and modified using shared components. This should result in faster development and consistent designs across the app. But getting there is a slow and painful process.When implementing a design system you have to make many decisions, like: Where do you start? What actually makes a component? And how flexible should components be? This talk will shed some light on these issues by taking you through Deliveroo's process of adopting the design system in its three Android apps.

      Is your team not reviewing code? You should be! Does it feel like you could be getting more out of code reviews? Absolutely! Code reviews are severely underutilized.  Let me show you some approaches to get more value from code reviews for you and your team. I will emphasize code review best practices starting with why you should be performing code reviews.  Some teams don't perform reviews and this is really hurting them in the long run. I will attempt to sell the review process and explain why it is fundamental to our roles as developers.  Teams that are performing reviews may feel burdened by doing so and see it as chore. This also is not ideal and I will dig a little deeper and discuss why we feel this way sometimes. What are the strategies to overcome this feeling? Is it possible to enjoy code review?Are there shortcuts to work more efficiently at reviewing code? Absolutely! Can some things be automated? What can't? Let me show you some great approaches to making the review process streamlined and efficient.

      Koin (https://insert-koin.io) is a pragmatic dependency injection framework for Kotlin/Android developers. Let's see how it will make your life easier thanks to the power of Kotlin language: from basics to the setup of Android architecture's components, without forgetting the testing part... And of course, how to migrate your “old” Dagger project.

      Android apps are not just series of static screens. To create a great app you will have to bring it into life with meaningful, helpful and delightful motion.However, a good design is not worth much unless it gets implemented correctly. In this joint designer-developer talk we discuss the workflow from the idea, to design and development and all the way to user’ hands. We describe when to use motion and when not to as well as selecting the right type and right intensity of motion. We then dive into the best implementation strategies including communicating state, navigation, feedback, tutorial and delightful animations.

      You've been working as an engineer for a while, and now you want more. More responsibilities, more decision making power, more money. But where do you even start? Become an engineering manager right? Not so fast. In this talk, we'll go over how to choose the best career path for you. There are many ways of becoming the leader you know you deserve to be, and not all of them are obvious nor conventional. We'll cover the different options and the skills required to get there, but we'll also talk about why not to become a manager, or even a tech lead.Finally, you decide to make the jump. You "made it" right? But, now what? How to become the best leader you can possibly be? How to give constructive feedback? How to set expectations with your people? And what's next? Keep climbing?... or choose to go back to building.

      The fact that "apps" for the Google Assistant and for Android are both available on Android smartphones can be the cause of some confusion. Do I have to go to the Play Store to download and install an "app" for the Google Assistant? Can I launch a Google Assistant experience from an Android app? How to integrate advanced voice recognition (NLP or other) on existing apps? What experience should I offer on my app?  In this talk I will answer these questions, do a comparison of the ecosystems and how they can work together.

      Vector assets are lightweight and sharp on every screen size, but working with them can be complicated. Android doesn’t directly support SVG, potentially leading to conversion and ownership issues. This talk will cover what designers and developers need to know to work together to create static and animated vector assets. We’ll cover the capabilities of Android’s vector formats, how they influence producing assets in graphics packages (with a focus on Sketch) and how to efficiently export them. We'll also look at tooling and workflows that allow designers and devs to collaborate on creating vector animations.

      Deploying an Android app to the play store always contains some cost in it. Furthermore the user isn't always keen to download (again) our latest versioned app. How about doubling the cost of development with the iOS app into account (or Web)?  At Square, we came up with a system in which the server owns the workflow of the client. This means the client doesn't know before hand which screen, which image or text it's gonna show next.In this talk, we'll:- Know why Square ended up choosing this system.- Discover how we built it.Look at the challenges, the pros and cons of such an architecture.- Talk about how we want to alter it for the future.Attendees to this talk will be expose to solutions for problems every company is facing but don't address.

      Grâce à Kotlin/Native, disponible en version 1.0 depuis octobre, il est désormais possible d’utiliser Kotlin pour créer nos applications back et mobile natives en utilisant un même langage. Mais, en 2019, est-ce déjà une solution réellement viable ? Dans ce talk, nous allons vous présenter un retour d’expérience sur la création de notre application : de la création des Web Services avec Ktor aux clients iOS et Android, en passant par l'industrialisation et les tests.

      You can run Android on a wide range of devices, not just phones and tablets. Building Android from scratch is fun and a great way to learn about the lower levels of the operating system. Imagine - here is a chance to create ANY Android configuration you want.In this presentation, I will show you how to take a Raspberry Pi 3 and build Android completely from scratch, using source code from the AOSP (Android Open Source Project). We will need a few things to make this work A Linux kernel that has been configured with the options that Android expects OpenGL ES graphics drivers HAL layers for graphics and networking, amongst other things

      Vector-drawables, 9 Patches, layer-list, multi-densities, screen sizes: Android provides many ways to use graphical resources in an application and deal with the fragmentation. The goal of this talk is to take a tour of the available resources that developers can use in their application, see what tools Android Studio provides to manage those resources, how these resources are embedded into the APK and what how the framework uses them at runtime.

      Do you exactly know what's your app doing when you deliver it to your users? Are you 100% sure? Would you bet on this? You're probably confident with the code you wrote and you know what is doing. We pull dependencies from the online repositories every day. Our applications strongly rely on external libraries that are hosted on public Maven repositories. What if one of those library contains some malicious code? Imagine a library that starts harvesting your user data without you knowing it.In this talk we will see how to monitor and protect your application from malicious dependency on the web that might end up in your final compiled App.

      As developers, more often than not, you have access to fast and reliable internet connection, all day long. But the users you target won't. Limited data plans, unreliable network coverage, commuting : those are real obstacle that your users will see daily. This means that network will only be available at some times, and not necessarily when the user wants to interact with your application.Our talk will focus on creating a user experience with ‘offline’ being the default working state, and having access to the internet being a bonus for your users. We’ll see how to design your UI/UX to make offline more than an edge case scenario, as well as how to architecture your application, and which tools and libraries can help you to implement it.

Alors viendez, ça ne sera toujours pas plus drôle, ni plus intelligent mais vous pourrez dire en sortant: "Je ne sais absolument pas pourquoi j'ai été voir ça", et ça, ça n'a pas de prix.
