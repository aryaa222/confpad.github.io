      Today, very often you can hear a lot of buzz words, but even among them, DevOps and Microservices excite the minds of people as something special. For a typical engineer, DevOps and Microservices are just a marketing profanity. It's more important to "keep DevOps in your hands" and be able to use it. I want to understand where our and other people's fantasies come to an end, where really useful practices begin, what tools will help us and what fundamental principles will help increase the profit from the used practices and tools. The talk is primarily about the implementation of various technologies, tools and methodologies in a large organization. I will share the problems that we encountered in the implementation of various principles and technologies, I will talk about solutions and developed principles of scaling processes / tools. Today our slogan will be "DevOps in the hands and not in the heads." But what is in the minds is still important, although this is a completely different story.

      Infrastructure as Code (IaC), one of the DevOps practices, assumes a declarative description of the infrastructure resources required to deploy and test the build / project. Accordingly, there should be a mechanism for automating the processing of such declarative files and allocating / modifying the necessary resources. In the public cloud of Microsoft Azure, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) serves as the mechanism, and the so-called ARM templates (ARM Templates) perform the role of declarative files. In the report you will get acquainted with the structure of ARM-templates and the variants of their application in CI / CD. In addition, you will learn how these templates can be applied in the Azure Stack - the hardware and software complex, on the basis of which a subset of Microsoft Azure services is provided locally

      In a large project, you can not just take it and make it available to all customers. Therefore, experiments are conducted that require manual changes that lead to time costs and sometimes errors. To remove these factors, Odnoklassniki decided to automate the preparation and launch of experiments. In the report, Alexander Tarasov will tell you why Kotlin was chosen for this, rather than the classic configuration management tools (such as Ansible), why a good DSL and toolkit are critical to this task and what problems had to be overcome in order for everything to work as originally conceived.

And in order to build a full-fledged report, you need to place these annotations in your project.But what if your project is not adapted to use these annotations, for example, do not you use @Step? In my report I will talk about Allure Lifecycle, who solve this problem by the example of integrations with the well-known libraries Selenide, Retfofit, AspectJ.

      There are at least a dozen continuous integration solutions out there, but the majority of them are challenging to learn, scale, and debug. Most importantly, few of them were designed with pipelines in mind. Not able to find a tool that could handle something as massive and complex as Cloud Platform (Cloud Foundry), Pivotal, a spin-off of VMWare, decided to write their own. This resulted in Concourse CI, a user-friendly continuous delivery technology that focuses on pipelines, is easy to scale, runs anywhere, and works with anything. During the talk I will tell about real world implementation of CD/CI and DevOps with help of Concourse and tell how to boost release engineering practice with the help of this instrument.

The CI / CD pipeline, which will be demonstrated during the presentation, does not depend on the particular cloud hosting, it is suitable for any k8s cluster. Therefore, it is possible to run Kubernetes locally, in AWS or Google Cloud or Azure. A private register of containers will also be created in Azure, but you can use any register of containers which depends on your own choice.

      It is predicted that till 2025 there will be over 75 billion devices spewing 180 zettabytes of data and generating up to 6 trillion dollars. That enormous increase force companies to introduce continuous approach to deliver product as fast as possible and be able to compete on the market.The main question is how to test application for end user among so much hardware equipment and ecosystems combining HW, FW, mobile devices and complex backend architecture? Considering all factors and possible obstacles is it for companies a real “A New Hope” for companies or just simply “Mission Impossible”?I will take the participants on a journey to the IoT world. It will be a talk about the challenges that any tester will face at some point. I will present the dangers, risks and snares but also good practices and practical approach to E2E test automation for the IoT solutions in CI approach.Technical examples will be presented using Python languages and supported by physical devices.

      So, you end up looking at thousands UI-level automated tests and yet 50% code coverage for a 7-years old product. Current test automation infrastructure already cannot support the load, AQA specialists are barely coping with maintenance and automation for stories in progress.What would you do? Would you scale?Would you go for clichéd “Test automation pyramid”?What would you make your priority, is it coverage or efficiency?Let’s see what we tried in such situation and where we could go with it.

      Testing community is discussing how machine learning can find bugs and replace testers. Meanwhile the reality is more boring and not so much futuristic. Engineers are releasing machine learning and artificial intelligence services that should be tested. Based on real experience of delivering such products I want to share how different such testing is from regular solutions and what are possible problems. After my talk you’ll have a starting point to test this AI and ML magic once you are faced with it.

      During last several years DevOps became strong buzzword used almost in every project, team and company. But almost everywhere it is used in very funny and strange context. For example, existing ops guys are renamed to DevOps just to sell them to the client for more money. Or DevOps is used as new job title for some magically powerful person who is able to operate cloud environment and modern infrastructure related tools, leading team of old school ops and participating in management meetings. In this talk I’m going to review all different anti-patterns and bad practices in DevOps landscape using stories from my personal experience as Delivery Manager and independent consultant.

      Nowadays, many organizations are challenging agile and focus more on DevOps as their brand new ALM methodology. Devops can be regarded as a next generation methodology beyond agile, especially with it’s special focus on test automation.If you want your organization to survive in today's agile world, you need to learn and adapt to the changing landscape of Devops and utilize test automation to help speed delivery and high quality. When it comes to a successful DevOps transformation, test automation is one of the keys.Beyond any doubt, whether you establish a solid test automation framework yourself or someone does it for you, it will bring many benefits into your Devops environment. Some of the most critical ones include: a powerful foundation to cope with the software testing challenges and a systematic approach to shorten the time-to-market delivery by supporting the quality of your products in preliminary stages.My session mainly focuses on the challenges of Devops and Test Automation and it will guide attendees to practically utilize different aspects of test automation based on the experiences of Devops and Agile.

      In this talk, we’ll talk about the key measurements for the DevOps transformation process and provide you with 3 metrics you can start measuring tomorrow.Devops is usually viewed from a traditional perspective of a collaboration of Dev, Ops, and QA, driven by the change in Culture, People, and Process. But how do you know where you stand and where to move? As in almost any field, data and metrics give you the gauges and instruments. In this talk, we’ll talk about the key measurements for the DevOps transformation process and provide you with 3 metrics you can start measuring tomorrow.
